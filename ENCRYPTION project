Problem Statement

Securing the User from OTP theft by Hackers or Man in the middle attack


Solution:

Here we Secured The User from OTP theft by sending OTP in an encoded format to the User So that the Hacker can't see the OTP in the TEXT format.Here we used Two Modules 

1.WEB Module
2.Android Module


1.WEB Module
   Here we used the HTML to Design the Website and we used PHP to send the Otp to the User from the Web page we created
   We used base64 encoding method to encrypt the OTP from server side and send it to User.Further in Development it can be upgraded to High Level Encryption Methods to Encrypt the OTP
   Then we used textLocal API to send the message from our web application because they give us 10 free credits messages 

2.Android Module
   Here we used Android Studio to Design Our Android application for The user to automatically Detect and Decrypt the OTP and we used java as our programming language
   We used the base64 method  for Decoding the OTP received by the user. 
   Here in this application we designed the code where the OTP is detected by our CYBERGAINTS application and it will Decrypt the encoded format to the Original Text OTP and it will be seen only in our CYBERGAINTS application by the user.So that hacker is unaware of the OTP received by the User
   
   
   
Feautres:
   The Decrypted OTP is show only inside the CYBERGAINTS Android Application that we had Created
   Because another person cant see the Decrypted OTP and he is unaware of the Android application inside the User Mobile
   So only user Knows the OTP


Scenario and Conclusion:
   If the User Mobile is in the hands of hacker and he initiates the transaction and he recieves the OTP from the bank and he puts the OTP and he gonna complete the Transaction
   So we Developed the above Solution 
   Hence the User is Safe from Otp Theft.
